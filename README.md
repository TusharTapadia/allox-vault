# ALLO-X Vault Protocol

This project mimics an onchain vault deployed for real world assets like stocks. 

The project is structred in such a way that user deploys a vault in a particular chain and add oracles aggregator which can be chainlink or a fork of chainlink. 
This fetches the prices from these oracles and then use them to issue or burn tokens according to vault structure. 

This has contracts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```
# allox-vault
